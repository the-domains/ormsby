The **New Zealand national men's rugby union team**, officially nicknamed the **All Blacks**, represents [New Zealand][0] in men's [rugby union][1], which is regarded as the country's [national sport][2].[\[2\]][3]The All Blacks are the holders of the [Rugby World Cup][4], since [2011][5], and are the 2014 [World Rugby Team of the Year][6]. They have won over 76% of their [test matches][7]and are the leading test match points scorers of all time. Their win ratio puts them amongst the most successful teams of any sport in history. They are the only international side with a winning record against every country they have played, and since their international debut in 1903 only five nations have defeated New Zealand in test matches.[\[a\]][8]Since the introduction of the[World Rugby Rankings][9] in October 2003, New Zealand has held number one ranking longer than all other teams combined.[\[3\]][10]The All Blacks are also the first team to have set hands on the Webb Ellis Cup, the first team to successfully defend the Rugby World Cup and the first team to win the cup on 3 separate occasions.

New Zealand competes with [Argentina][11], [Australia][12] and [South Africa][13] in [The Rugby Championship][14] -- known as the Tri Nations before Argentina's entry in 2012\. The All Blacks have won the trophy thirteen times in the competition's nineteen-year history. They also hold the [Bledisloe Cup][15], which is contested annually with Australia, and the [Freedom Cup][16], contested annually with South Africa. New Zealand have achieved a [Grand Slam][17](defeating England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in one tour) four times -- 1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010\.

They have also been named the World Rugby Team of the Year seven times since 2005\.[\[4\]][18]Four members have won the World Rugby Player of the Year award -- current captain [Richie McCaw][19], [Dan Carter][20], [Kieran Read][21], and [Brodie Retallick][22]. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the [International Rugby Hall of Fame][23]; four of these are also inductees of the [World Rugby Hall of Fame][24].

The team's first match was in 1884, and their first international match in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year they hosted their first ever home Test, a match against a British Isles side in [Wellington][25].[\[b\]][26]This was followed by a [tour of Europe and North America][27] in 1905 where the team suffered their first test defeat -- to Wales in Cardiff.

New Zealand's early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. By the 1905 tour, they were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and their name_All Blacks_dates from this time.

The team perform a [haka][28] -- a [Māori][29] challenge or posture dance -- before each match. The haka performed has traditionally been [Te Rauparaha][30]'s _[Ka Mate][31]_, although since 2005 _Kapa o Pango_ -- a modified version of the 1924 All Blacks haka, _Kia Whaka-ngawari_ -- has occasionally been performed.
